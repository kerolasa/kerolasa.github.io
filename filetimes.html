            What are atime, ctime and mtime?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Files, directories, fifos, sockets and device files
            (later on refered as files) has three different time
            values. Normally no-one is interested of these time
            values, but when something strange happens people tend
            look up when something happened and then you need to
            understand what are these times.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>ctime.</b> Many times this is understood as a
            creation time but that wrong. Ctime is change time of
            file stats such as ownership, what permissions it has
            etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>mtime.</b> File modification time. Value of mtime is
            updated when content of file changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>atime.</b> File access time. Value of atime is
            modified when file is opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            As said above no-one is interested of these file times.
            all thou you can catch possible system cracker by
            checking file mtime and ctimes of binaries and
            important files. If you are unlucky system cracker
            knows how to use touch and time values are same as they
            where before. Then you need real file integrity checker
            to catch intruder.
        </p>
        <p>
            All three time values are implemented in normal file
            systems, but if you mount some exotic file system you
            cannot be sure that they all present, see your
            documentation for more info about this. Note that there
            are file systems that you can mount so that atime will
            not ever get modified. With this file system feature
            you can gain better performance in some situations. See
            your documentations does your file system has this
            feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this file statistics program <a href=
            "stat.c">stat.c</a>
            you can check time values and other things about files.
