<h3>What are atime, ctime and mtime?</h3>
<p>Files, directories, fifos, sockets and device files (later on refered as
files) has three different time values. Normally no-one is interested of these
time values, but when something strange happens people tend look up when
something happened and then you need to understand what are these times.</p>
<p><b>ctime.</b> Many times this is understood as a creation time but that
wrong. Ctime is change time of file stats such as ownership, what permissions
it has etc.</p>
<p><b>mtime.</b> File modification time. Value of mtime is updated when content
of file changes.</p>
<p><b>atime.</b> File access time. Value of atime is modified when file is
opened.</p>
<p>As said above no-one is interested of these file times. all thou you can
catch possible system cracker by checking file mtime and ctimes of binaries and
important files. If you are unlucky system cracker knows how to use touch and
time values are same as they where before. Then you need real file integrity
checker to catch intruder.</p>
<p>All three time values are implemented in normal file systems, but if you
mount some exotic file system you cannot be sure that they all present, see
your documentation for more info about this. Note that there are file systems
that you can mount so that atime will not ever get modified. With this file
system feature you can gain better performance in some situations. See your
documentations does your file system has this feature.</p>
<p>With this file statistics program <a href="stat.c">stat.c</a> you can check
time values and other things about files.</p>
