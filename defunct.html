        <p>You cannot kill a defunct process. A defunct (or
        &quot;zombie&quot;) process is a process that isn&#39;t running,
        isn&#39;t eligible to run, and takes up no system resources.
        It&#39;s actually a process that has exited, but its parent has
        not called wait() in order to find out its exit status. The
        kernel will keep the zombie process around until the parent makes
        calls wait().</p>
        <p>There are no adverse effects from having a defunct process
        around, other than the fact it takes up a miniscule amount of
        space in some kernel data structures somewhere and the fact it
        reminds you that you have some less than ideal software
        somewhere.</p>
        <p>(You might use something like &#39;ps -deafl&#39; to find the
        parent of the defunct process -- look under the PPID field. If
        you can somehow make the parent process call wait(), or if you
        kill it, the defunct process should go away.)</p>
        <p>Hope that helps...</p>
