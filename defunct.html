<p>You cannot kill a defunct process. A defunct (or "zombie") process is a
process that isn't running, isn't eligible to run, and takes up no system
resources. It's actually a process that has exited, but its parent has not
called wait() in order to find out its exit status. The kernel will keep the
zombie process around until the parent makes calls wait().</p>
<p>There are no adverse effects from having a defunct process around, other
than the fact it takes up a miniscule amount of space in some kernel data
structures somewhere and the fact it reminds you that you have some less than
ideal software somewhere.</p>
<p>(You might use something like 'ps -deafl' to find the parent of the defunct
process -- look under the PPID field. If you can somehow make the parent
process call wait(), or if you kill it, the defunct process should go
away.)</p>
<p>Hope that helps...</p>
<p>Adios,<br>
