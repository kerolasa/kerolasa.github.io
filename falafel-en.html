<h2>Sami's Falafel</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Get split <span>chickpeas</span>, 4 decilitres is enough. Keep
under water for couple hours.</p>
<p>Get rid of water. Squash chickpea's, use of cutting mixer or
stick blener makes the task easy. When done add following
substances to dough.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least two onions, chop to quite small pieces.</li>
<li>Garlic, nearly impossible to put too much, and chop em.</li>
<li>Parsley bush. Shred to pieces.</li>
<li><span>Salt</span>.</li>
<li>Pile of <span>cumin</span>.</li>
<li>Chilli power or oil, nearly impossible to put too much.</li>
<li>Extensive hunk of <span>tahini</span>.</li>
<li>Splash of water, if needed. In case you added melons to recipe,
then not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to make moist dough. Not wet, or glue like. If the
dough seem too wet add flour.</p>
<p>When you think you're done with dough taste it. If it's not good
add something. If you chose to change the ingredients, just do not
take out <span>must haves</span> highlighted with different font.
Falafel is basically a vegetable ball, so you can use nearly
anything non-meat. Potatoes, carrots, rutabaga, corn, spinach,
dill, your imagination is the limit. Avoid anything terribly wet,
melon would be really difficult to get working. All sorts of spices
are good idea; peppers, turmeric, and herbs will most likely
improve your falafel. The main point is; if dough tests good, the
end product will be good.</p>
<h3>The Algorithm - 2 persons needed</h3>
<p>Put litre or so oil to pot and get it hot. Good temperature is
not far from ignition point, or what ever make you a bit
afraid.</p>
<p>Make balls out of the dough. Using two spoons is good method to
do this. Size of a ball is roughly same what you would think a
proper meat ball should look like. Avoid doing super large balls,
they don't cook from middle at all.</p>
<p>The first ball is a tester. If ball breaks while boiling it your
dough is too wet. Aim is to make balls crisp on surface soft from
inside.</p>
<p>Once a test ball is successfully done it's time to make
production line. One person rolls dough balls, while the another
frying. Doing this alone is guaranteed misery with half of the
falafel ending up either burned or raw.</p>
