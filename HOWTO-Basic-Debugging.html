This document contains notes on how to do "Basic Debugging" of problems
seen while running BaBar executables. Here "Basic Debugging" is defined
as obtaining the basic information necessary to file a useful Remedy
problem report (while not necessarily solving the problem oneself). It
includes short sections on debuggers, types of crashes, the use of
Framework Actions, hung jobs and filing a useful problem report.

  1. Introduction

  The BaBar code base consists of many millions of lines of code and
a large number of executables are in general use on (as I write this)
three different platforms. Almost all of us will at times come up
against various types of crashes or hangs while running executables
with which we are not 100% familiar.

  The purpose of this HOWTO is to explain the basic debugging techniques
that would be used by a relatively expert user who has a problem while
running an unfamiliar executable. It is hoped that after reading
this HOWTO even users that do not feel themselves expert will find
that they have the basic tools in hand for putting together (a) a useful
problem report for the expert on the problematic code and (b) figuring
out who that expert would be or where to send the report (and perhaps
even resolving the problem him/herself).

  A large fraction of the notes in this document will apply to debugging
of any piece of code with which you may work, but some parts will clearly
be BaBar specific. The emphasis is more on debugging problems that
come from executables themselves rather than "external" problems, hence
there will be no explicit discussion of objectivity, root or infrastructure
problems (afs, nfs, network, etc.).



  2. Reporting problems

  Before diving in to any technical details as to how to pull together
information for a problem report, this section contains information
on what information is useful and where does one post this information.

   2.1 Where to post a problem report

  In BaBar, we use Remedy to report and track problems in our code. However,
before posting a Remedy report, it is useful (and recommended) to search
to see if that problem has already appeared either in Remedy or in
Hypernews (HN). Often problem reports first appear in HN groups as people
try to understand if a particular problem is due to user error or the
code itself. Both HN and Remedy are described in a later section.

  A useful strategy for proceeding when you have a problem while
running some BaBar executable (such as a crash) is:

    o Verify that..
        - you can make the crash happen again
        - you are running standard code, i.e., part of a babar release
        - you are running on a correctly installed base
        - if you have new code in the executable, you should have
          established, with reasonable diligence, that your code is
          not the site of the crash.
        - you have a good build.

       ...To Finish...



   2.2 What information is useful?

    When posting a question to HN or a bug report to Remedy it is
    important to remember that the people reading the problem report
    don't really know what you are doing (there are hundreds of people
    doing many different things in many different ways in BaBar), so
    providing a basic set of information can really simplify things.
    The goal should be to provide enough information such that the
    exact situation can be recognized and/or duplicated if necessary. A
    basic set of useful information would include:

     o Executable being run and tcl script

     o Release and platform - What code release were using? Which
         platform?

     o Tags checked out - Were there any additonal tags check out
         in the test release or did you make any modifications?

     o Environment variables set - Did you have an special environment
         variables set which would affect the running of the job? (Or
         perhaps while the executable was being compiled/linked, for
         example in Beta.)

     o Patch files, if any, e.g., BearPatches.tcl.

     o Type of crash - See section 3 below.

     o Traceback - See section 4 and 5 below.

     o Input type, collection, objectivity or kanga - if relevant, if
         you see the same result with multiple collections that is
         also useful information.

     o event number, begin-of-job or end-of-job? - What event did the
         crash happen in? Or did it happen as the beginning or end of job?

      All of this information may not be necessary in every case, but
      you will likely be asked for more information from the list if
      your problem is not recognized by the expert.



  3. Types of crashes

  The first thing to note is that when your program crashes, the last (or
one of the last) lines in your log file from that job will contain
some printout like (for example) "Segmentation fault". What this tells
you right away is what type of "signal" was sent to your program when
it tried to do something that caused the crash. A general discusion
of "signals" is beyond the scope of this HOWTO, but as this is the first
clue one usually has as to what has happened, this section describes the
most common ones and describes the sort of things that may cause them.
This is not intended to be exhaustive, but instead to point out that
the "signal" sent already contains some useful information.

  By way of introduction, in Unix, the interface between a program and
the operating system (the kernel) is meant to mimic common hardware
interfaces.  For example, when a piece of hardware, say a disk controller,
needs the attention of the CPU, it can issue a special electrical signal
called an interrupt.  The processor is diverted, as a result, from its
thread of execution so that it can attend the disk drive.  The processor
can mask interrupts when it is doing critical things, and there are many
kinds of interrupts (signals) that can occur.

  The interface between your program and the operating system follows
this metaphor.  When something important happens, as detected by the
kernel, your program will be delivered an interrupt (a signal) that
your program may process.  There is a predetermined set of these
signals (see below and /usr/include/sys/signal.h or a POSIX guide) and
you may associate a piece of code to execute upon the receipt of any
of the signals.  If you have no "signal handler" installed to "catch"
the delivery of a signal, your program is terminated.

  A number of common signals are used to indicate severe program
faults, as described next.

  Note that there is some variation in the printout seen with
platform and compiler. Below I include also the common abbreviations (e.g.
"SEGV"). So without further ado:

    o SEGV - A segmentation violation or segmentation fault typically
             means that something is trying to access memory that
             it shouldn't be accessing. One common example of this is
             trying to access memory through a NULL pointer, for example:

         sunprompt&gt; cat main.c
         #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
         main()
         {
           int* bunk(0);
           cout &lt;&lt; *bunk &lt;&lt; endl;
         }
         sunprompt&gt; CC main.c
         sunprompt&gt; ./a.out
         Segmentation fault (core dumped)

    o ABRT  - asserts are one common source of the "abort" signal, for
              example:

         sunprompt&gt; cat main.c
         #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
         main()
         {
           int i=0;
           assert(i!=0);
         }
         sunprompt&gt; CC main.c
         sunprompt&gt; ./a.out
         Assertion failed: i!=0, file main.c, line 5
         Abort (core dumped)

         Note that the actual assertion which was failed and the location
         is also printed.

    o FPE - A "Floating Point Error" usually indicates a numerical
            problem such as a division by zero or an overflow. One
            example would be:

         osfprompt&gt; cat main.c
         main()
         {
           float a = 1.;
           float b = 0.;
           float c = a/b;
         }
         osfprompt&gt; g++ main.c
         osfprompt&gt; ./a.out
         Floating exception (core dumped)

    o ILL - If you receive a signal like this ("Illegal Instruction"), means
            that, while running, your program has tried to execute a
            machine "instruction" which does not exist. This can happen
            for a variety of reasons, including:

           (a) a memory overwrite that happens to overwrite part of the
               program stored in memory. This may result in the program
               trying, for example, to execute data as if it is a
               machine instruction.
           (b) an attempt to take an executable compiled on one platform
               for use on another, for example on an earlier version of
               the same chip.
           (c) a truncated or corrupted executable is loaded for
               execution
           (d) incomplete recompilation of source code, i.e. you changed
               one C++ clas and didn't recompile all other code affected by
               that change.

    o BUS - A "Bus Error" may come, for example, from accessing unaligned
            data (i.e. like trying to access a 4 byte integer with a
            pointer to the middle of it). What this means will vary
            from platform to platform. (I haven't come up with a good
            example of this one yet.)

            A "Bus Error" can also often indicate a memory overwrite,
            e.g. somebody wrote a number where a pointer is kept.
            _Often_ caused by going past the end of an array and into
            the system pointers at the start of the next memory block.


  4. Debuggers

  The previous section described at a basic level the types of signals that
may occur. If our programs were only 10 lines long, the "signal" would
be enough to understand the origin of any crash by simple code inspection.
Our executables are clearly much larger than this, so the next step is
to determine what the code was doing when the crash occured. The easiest
way to do this is to use a debugger.

   4.1 core files

    After a crash, you should find a "core" file in the directory where
    the program was being executed. This is a memory image of the
    process when it crashed and can be used to figure out what
    the process was doing when the crash occured. If your job crashes
    and you do not find a "core" file, your shell settings are probably
    set to avoid core dumps:

      - If you use tcsh:

        o type 'limit coredumpsize'. The value is probably set to '0'.
        o type 'limit coredumpsize unlim' to remove the limit.

      - If you use bash:

        o type 'ulimit -c'. The value is probably set to '0'.
        o type 'ulimit -c unlimited' to remove the limit.

    You will have to rerun your executable and after it crashes again you
    should find a core file. To check that the core file does in
    fact come from the executable you were running, type 'file core'. It
    will tell you which executable the core comes from as well as some other
    information. (Not all systems do this, but our three supported systems
    Sun, Linux2 and OSF do.) See section 11.1 for details about handling
    very large core files.

   4.2 dbx (Sun)

    The non-GUI debugger available on Sun is called 'dbx'. As an example
    of using the debugger to examine a core file, here is a slightly
    modified version of the program which caused the SEGV above:

        sunprompt&gt; cat main.c
        #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
        void foo() {
          int* bunk(0);
          cout &lt;&lt; *bunk &lt;&lt; endl;
        }

        main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
          foo();
        }
        sunprompt&gt; CC -g main.c
        sunprompt&gt; ./a.out
        Segmentation fault (core dumped)
        sunprompt&gt; dbx a.out core
        Reading symbolic information for a.out
        core file header read successfully
        Reading symbolic information for rtld /usr/lib/ld.so.1
        dbx: program is not active
        Reading symbolic information for libm.so.1
        Reading symbolic information for libC.so.5
        Reading symbolic information for libw.so.1
        Reading symbolic information for libc.so.1
        Reading symbolic information for libdl.so.1
        Reading symbolic information for libc_psr.so.1
        program terminated by signal SEGV (no mapping at the fault address)
        Current function is foo
            4     cout &lt;&lt; *bunk &lt;&lt; endl;
        (dbx) where
        =&gt;[1] foo(), line 4 in "main.c"
          [2] main(argc = 1, argv = 0xeffff2fc), line 9 in "main.c"
        (dbx) quit

     Compilation/linking of a real BaBar executable is clearly
     done differently than this toy example, but a traceback is
     obtained in the same way. For a crash in BetaApp, for
     example, one would type:

     sunprompt&gt; dbx BetaApp core

     and then 'where' as above. For more details on interpreting the
     the traceback, see section 5.

     For more information on commands type 'help' at the dbx prompt.

     The dbx debugger on Sun has one quirk with templates, if you see
     alot of complaints about them when you type 'where', simply type
     'where' a second time and they will go away (leaving you with a
     clean traceback).

   4.3 ladebug (OSF)

     On OSF a debugger called 'dbx' exists, but it is not for use with C++.
     The C++ debugger is called 'ladebug' (it can also be used for Fortran
     and C). As for dbx, it is launched to examine a core file with:

     osfprompt&gt; ladebug your.exe core

     where "your.exe" is the name of your executable.

     The command 'where' will work as for dbx. For more information on
     commands, see the man page ('man ladebug') or type 'help' at the
     ladebug prompt.

   4.4 gdb (Linux)

     The most common debugger used on linux is 'gdb'. The syntax for
     examining a core file is:

     linuxprompt&gt; gdb your.exe core

     Some basic information is available from the man page ('man gdb'),
     but for detailed further information on gdb on linux type
     'info gdb'. The command 'where' will work, equivalent alternatives
     in gdb are 'backtrace' or 'bt'.

   4.5 Sun Workshop (Sun)

     There is a product called Workshop on the suns.  It provides a graphical
     interface to debugging tools and it lives in /opt/SUNWspro/bin/workshop.
     Executing this command brings up a small list of icons.  The one with a
     bug under a red barred-circle starts the debugger.  The one that looks
     like a histogram is a performance analyzer.  There are help boxes and
     web pages you can call up.  The debugger can analyze memory usage
     patterns (see the "Windows" pull-down) as well as performance data.
     The basic pattern for the latter is to locate the menu with the
     "Collector" item and launch it.  (This menu is in the debugger).  Select
     what you want the Collector to monitor, then begin execution under
     the debugger.  When the program finishes, launch the Analyzer, which
     will show you timing distributions.  You tell the analyzer the name
     of the "experiment" that you set in the Collector window.
     Note that the analyzer has trouble running on a display that is
     fed by a channel established with ssh.

     The workshop debugger is really just a facade on top of dbx.  You
     can use it to *learn* about dbx by asking it to show the dbx window.
     You drive the debugger with its GUI and watch what dbx commands come
     out.  Or, you can just do whizbang stuff with the dbx window when the
     GUI is not sufficient.


   4.6 Other misc. notes

       ...To Finish...

      o debugging symbols, optimization
      o core files versus running in the debugger itself



  5. Obtaining information from a traceback (an example)

  Here is an example traceback obtained from a crash of Elf (Remedy
report 3455):

t@1 (l@1) signal SEGV (no mapping at the fault address) in MapChipNode::nChannels (optimized)
=&gt;[1] MapChipNode::nChannels(this = (nil)) (optimized), at 0x133a9d4
[2] L1DTsfTCDigiModule::convert(this = ???, list = ???, tc = ???) (optimized), at 0xcc80b0
[3] L1DTsfTCDigiModule::event(this = ???, anEvent = ???) (optimized), at 0xcc7ec8
[4] APPSequence::event(this = ???, anEvent = ???) (optimized), at 0x1562af4
[5] APPSequence::event(this = ???, anEvent = ???) (optimized), at 0x1562af4
[6] APPSequence::event(this = ???, anEvent = ???) (optimized), at 0x1562af4
[7] AppFramework::event(this = ???, anEvent = ???) (optimized), at 0x155a570
[8] OepFrameworkDriver::processTransition(this = 0xefffe840, tr = 0xed300008), at 0x134fc8c
[9] OepFrameworkDriver::processDatum(this = 0xefffe840, datum = 0x49b2f18), at 0x134d618
[10] OepFrameworkDriver::readLoop(this = 0xefffe840), at 0x134cb44
[11] OepFrameworkDriver::init(this = 0xefffe840, interp = 0x31b03c8), at 0x134c684
[12] OepFTclMain::run(this = 0xefffe840, argc = 1, argv = 0x31ab4d4), at 0x134a6f4
[13] main(0x2, 0xefffea04, 0x1a50fd8, 0x31ab4d0, 0x31b0340, 0x0), at 0x869ec0

The first thing that appears in the traceback is the "signal" received (SEGV
in this case, see section 3) and then the entire series of "frames" or
functions called. The lowest numbered one is the one in which the problem
occured and you can see the entire sequence of calls all the way back up to
the "main" routine of the program.

  Several things can be seen immediately:

     o This crash is a SEGV and from Frame "[1]" we can see that the
       nChannels member function of a "MapChipNode" object has been
       called through a null pointer (note that this = nil)
     o The Framework module that was running at the time this happened
       was L1DTsfTCDigiModule (follow up the traceback until you get
       to the first one of the form Xxxx::event, this will likely be
       the guilty module if event processing was going on).


  6. Hung jobs

   Occasionally you may find that you run an executable and it "hangs",
i.e. it seems to stop making progress processing events or whatever it
should be doing and stays in one place without any further output. How
to debug this?

   One first clue as to what is happening is if the process is taking
CPU or not (i.e. look with 'top' or something similar on the machine where
the job is running). If it is taking lots of CPU without seemingly
progressing, it may be caught in an infinite loop. If the job doesn't
take CPU, it may be waiting for something. For more information as
to what is going on, there are a couple of possiblities:

   6.1 attaching processes in the debugger

       All of the debuggers that we currently use (see section 4 above)
       also allow one to "attach" an already running process to see what
       it is doing. First determine the process ID for your running
       executable and then do (on linux for example):

       linuxprompt&gt; gdb your.exe &lt;PID&gt;

       where "your.exe" is the name of the executable you are running
       (including the path if necessary) and &lt;PID&gt; is the process ID
       for the running process. Analogous things are available for
       the other debuggers (see the man page for those). You need to do
       this on the machine where the job is running (clearly) and will
       in general only be able to attach processes which belong to you.

       Once you are in the debugger, you can type 'where' or anything
       else you might do to get more information about what is going
       on.

   6.2 pstack on SunOS5 - On the Solaris machines there is a useful command
       which will provide a traceback-like list of function calls for
       a running executable. Simply determine the process ID of the running
       executable with 'top' or 'ps' and then do

       sunprompt&gt; /usr/proc/bin/pstack &lt;PID&gt;

       where &lt;PID&gt; is the process ID.



  7. Useful Framework features and tricks

   7.1 NameAction

       The Framework has a variety of "Action's", one of the most useful
       ones for debugging is "NameAction".

       Consider the following situation, for example: occasionally a
       memory overwrite can render a traceback useless:

       Thread received signal SEGV
       pc address 0x100000000 is invalid; substituting RA
       stopped at [ 0x100000001]
       (ladebug) where
       &gt;0 0x100000001

       In this case it is clear that a memory overwrite has happened,
       the program counter (pc, which normally contains the memory
       address of the next machine instruction to execute) has an
       unrealistic value.

       To determine which Framework module was running when this happened,
       add the two lines:

       action enable NameAction

       to your tcl file just before the 'ev begin'. The Action prints
       a message just before and after

       &lt;...&gt;
       APPExecutable: SvtEffMon: before processing an event...
       APPExecutable: SvtEffMon: after processing an event...
       APPExecutable: DchOprMon: before processing an event...
       Thread received signal SEGV
       pc address 0x100000000 is invalid; substituting RA
       stopped at [ 0x100000001]
       (ladebug) where
       &gt;0 0x100000001

       and which module was running at the time becomes clear. The output
       is a bit, well, voluminous given the number of modules typically
       running so this is clearly useful only for debugging and not for
       routine running! In addition to cases like this particular
       example, NameAction can be useful to determine the origin of
       printout seen in the log file, verifying that the beginJob(..)
       or event(...) function of a particular module is being called,
       etc.

       This Action should be included in most standard BaBar executables,
       if it seems to be missing check that you have something like the
       following in your AppUserBuild.cc:

    #include "RecoUtils/AppActionName.hh"
    //...
    theFramework-&gt;actions()-&gt;append(new AppActionName);


   7.2 Skipping events

        Occasionally a crash will happen well into
        an input file or collection and it is very useful for
        debugging to skip all events prior to the one in which the
        crash occurs. One way to do this is to use the fact that
        the module EvtCounter (which appears in most of the BaBar
        executables) is a Filter module. Suppose you want to skip
        to the 851st (sequential) event in an input collection, simply
        add the following to your tcl file:

        module talk EvtCounter
           skipStart set 1
           skipStop set 850
        exit

        and then do an 'ev begin -nev 851' to process only the 851st
        event (or 'ev begin' if you want to process all events starting
        from the 851st one).

        Skipping events is useful in many cases to examine a problematic
        event multiple times. In certain cases like memory overwrites,
        the crash may not appear unless the previous events are also
        processed so skipping events may not help.

        A faster method of doing this if you are reading from Objectivity
        is the following;

        module talk BdbEventInput
           first set 851
        exit

        You should note in this case that the EventCounter only see events
        starting at 851 and therefore only starts counting there.


  8. Searching the release for code fragments

  Often in the course of debugging, one will see either (a) a message
in the log file or (b) a function call in the traceback that comes from
someplace in the BaBar code base. It is often useful to figure out
which piece of code is the source of the message or function call.
The easiest way to do this is to use 'srtglimpse', which is a BaBar
specific wrapper around a general glimpse utility. It prints lines
from the BaBar code base which contain a given string.

  See the man page for 'srtglimpse' or type 'srtglimpse -h' for more
information, however here is one example:

    prompt&gt; srtglimpse -H 8.6.2 'foo'

will print:

    Aslund/src/fcstubs.F:       character*3 foo
    Aslund/src/fcstubs.F:       equivalence (i, foo)
    Aslund/src/fcstubs.F:       cdirtag = foo
    AssocTools/testAssocTools.cc:   anotherString = new RWCString("foober");
    &lt;...&gt;

(You might want to pipe the output to 'more' or 'less' if there will be
alot of it.) One thing to note is that 'srtglimpse' uses an "index"
which is made in advance (while the release is being built) in order to
make the search much faster. We make this index only for regular full
builds (not for lettered ones) so if you are interested in release
8.6.2a you will have to specify '-H 8.6.2' as in the example above.

 11. Misc. Tricks

   11.1 Putting the core file someplace besides the current directory

     Core files can be very big. If the directory where you run your
     executable (and where the core file would be dumped) is someplace
     where you have a limited quota (e.g. an afs volume or your home
     directory on many systems), you may find that you do not have enough
     space for your core file there. One trick which works on Sun and OSF
     (but not on Linux) is to use a soft link to put the core file
     someplace else:

     sunprompt&gt; touch $SOMEPLACE/core
     sunprompt&gt; ln -s $SOMEPLACE/core core

     where "$SOMEPLACE" here indicates some (presumably bigger) scratch
     space where you have write permission.

     Note also that dumping large core files to networked filesystems can
     take a long time, so there is some speed advantage if "$SOMEPLACE" is
     a disk local to the machine where the job is being run.

     If you are _really_ constrained for space, another possibility (that
     may allow you to at least get a traceback) is to limit your core
     file size such that it _will_ be truncated, i.e. in tcsh for example:

     sunprompt&gt; limit coredumpsize 5M

     and hope that there will be enough to get the traceback. Your mileage
     may vary doing this. (You could truncate it too much.)

   11.2 "watchmalloc" on Sun for finding memory management problems

     On Sun there is a method for finding certain types of memory
     management problems such as deleting the same object twice, use
     of uninitialized memory, etc. This uses a special shared library
     which replaces the default, you can use this by setting an
     environment variable (in tcsh for example):

     sunprompt&gt; setenv LD_PRELOAD watchmalloc.so.1

     Important: set this _only_ before running an executable interactively
     for debugging and make sure you 'unsetenv LD_PRELOAD' before (a)
     compiling/linking something or (b) submitting anything to the batch
     system. Both the batch system and the compiler have been seen
     to behave strangely if this is set. I have even seen a case where
     someone could not make the 'diff' command work properly with
     LD_PRELOAD set like this.

     So what does watchmalloc do? Many memory corruption problems do not
     actually cause a crash when the corruption actually happens, but only
     manifest themselves (as a crash) downstream in some other piece of
     code which is unlucky enough to need to use the corrupted memory.
     "watchmalloc" makes debugging easier by causing the crash to happen
     immediately when the corruption happens. So if (a) you think your
     problem may be due memory corruption as described above and (b)
     the actual traceback you find from the crash leads you to
     believe that the corruption is happening elsewhere, the strategy
     for using watchmalloc is:

       o compile code and link your executable
       o setenv LD_PRELOAD watchmalloc.so.1
       o run your executable _interactively_
       o if it crashes, examine the core file: the traceback should give
         you some indication of where the original corruption happened
       o make sure to 'unsetenv LD_PRELOAD' before doing anything else
         otherwise you may see strange behavior as noted above.

     For more information type 'man watchmalloc' on Sun.

   11.3 Truss and strace

       Sometimes programs fail because they fail to obtain expected
     resources, e.g., they fail to locate a file they need.  Such
     a program may not crash, but may just exit saying "Duh" or some
     other useless thing.  A great example occurs when you install
     stripped, licensed code that you can not put in a debugger, but
     which does not run when you first install it:  your guts tell you
     it is installed wrong, but how?

     There is a program called 'truss' on the Sun.  Linux has a similar
     program called 'strace'. (I am not aware of something similar on OSF,
     a "strace" program exists, but does something different.) These
     programs can attach to a running program or can run a program
     under them, e.g.

         sunprompt&gt; truss myProg -x paramX

     As the program executes, 'truss' and 'strace' watch for all system calls
     and print them out, along with arguments.  Systems calls include
     opening and closing files, memory requests, socket manipulations,
     etc.

     Quite often, you can strace an aberrant program and see a system
     call just before the program exits or fails that is obviously
     related, or even the cause, of the program failure.

   11.4 MALLOC_CHECK_ on Linux

     This is an alternative approach to watchmalloc on Sun. If you
     set this environment variable to 2 it will abort when it detects
     certain misuses of memory. Setting it to 1 will only print a
     message when these are detected.
