Sami's Falafel

Ingredients
===========

Get split chickpeas, 4 decilitres is enough. Keep under watre for
couple hours.

Get rid of water. Squash chickpea's, using mixer is the way to
go. When done add following substances to dough as hash.

* At least two onions.
* Garlic, nearly impossible to put too much.
* Parsley bush.
* Salt.
* Spoonful or two sodium.
* Pile of cumin.
* Chilli power or oil, nearly impossible to put too much.
* Splash of water.
* Extensive blob of tahini.

Your goal is to make moist dough. Not wet, or glue like. If the
dough seem too wet add flour.

When you think you're done with dough taste it. If it's not good
add something. Falafel is basically a vegetable ball, so you can
use nearly anything non-meat. Potatoes, carrots, rutabaga, corn,
spinach, dill, your imagination is the limit. While adding stuff
avoid anything wet, melon would not work. All sorts of spices
work really good; peppers, turmeric, herbs are great additions.
The prime point is; if dough is good, the outcome is good.

Algorithm (2 persons needed)
============================

Put litter or so oil to pot and get it hot. Good temperature is
not far from ignition point, or what ever make you a bit scary.

Make balls out of the dough. Using two spoons is good method to
do this. Size of a ball is roughly same what you would think a
meat ball should look like. Avoid doing super large balls, they
don't cook from middle at all.

The first ball is a tester. If ball breaks while boiling it your
dough is too wet. Aim is to make balls which are like bitter
ballen; crisp surface soft from inside.

Once the first ball is successfully done it's time to make
production line. One person rolls dough balls, another does the
boiling. Doing this alone is guaranteed misery; half of the
falafel is either burned or raw.
