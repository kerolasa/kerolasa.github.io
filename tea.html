<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-tea/finest-gunpowder-green">Gunpowder Green</a>
(4)</h2>
<p>2020-11-23.  Green Tea.  Not special, but sufficiently strong green tea.
Second brew is possible with this product, although by second round the tea
clearly has lost some aroma.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-tea/finest-kenyan">High Grown Kenyan</a>
(3)</h2>
<p>2020-11-23.  Black Tea.  A tea without faults or anything special.  Very
similar with the Strand Strong.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/gifts/discovery-collection/discovery-collection-pure-sencha-green-loose-tea">Sencha Green</a>
(3)</h2>
<p>2020-11-23.  Green tea.  Good one.  The first impression is this is quite
light in aroma.  An experiment with greater tea to water proportion is
needed.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-tea/signature-earl-grey">Signature Earl Grey</a>
(3)</h2>
<p>2020-11-23. Black tea.  Nothing wrong with this one.  I am coming to
conclusion Earl Gray is not really that interesting tea.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-tea/discovery-collection-forest-fruits-loose">Forest Fruits Black</a>
(5)</h2>
<p>2020-10-31.  Black tea.  Really nice smell.  Taste gives a little hint of
berries.  I like this one.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-black-tea/lapsang-souchong">Lapsang Souchong</a>
(4)</h2>
<p>2020-10-31.  Smoky black tea.  Great smell.  Fairly straightforward smoke
aroma.  To be honest; I wouldn't mind this being more smoky.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-black-tea/london-strand-strong-breakfast">London Strand Strong Breakfast</a>
(3)</h2>
<p>2020-10-31.  Black tea.  Good tea without faults.  Taste is better when
not boiling hot.  Similar to Darlington I had earlier, but not as
expensive.</p>

<h2>Twinings -
<a href="https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/loose-black-tea/nutty-chocolate-assam-loose-tea">Nutty Chocolate Assam</a>
(2)</h2>
<p>2020-10-31.  Black tea.  Smell has nice hazelnut aroma, but I don't like
test of it.  In wine terms this tea is too dry.  I guess this one would be
better with milk, but that is not how I drink my tea.</p>

<h2>Mariage Frères -
<a href="https://www.mariagefreres.com/UK/2-robe-rouge-supreme-blue-tea-china-T2315.html">Robe Rouge Suprême</a>
(4)</h2>
<p>2020-10-10.  Blue tea.  Taste give clear seaweed aroma.  Good one, but
this does require question is this worth the price?  Maybe once, but I doubt
twice.</p>

<h2>Mariage Frères -
<a href="https://www.mariagefreres.com/UK/2-darlington-T737.html">Darlington</a>
(3)</h2>
<p>2020-10-10.  Black tea.  Really good smell.  Not super interesting, but
nothing to complain.</p>

<h2>The Tea House -
<a href="https://theteahouseltd.com/rooibos/rooibos-cinnamon-vanilla/p-001329">Rooibos Cinnamon And Vanilla</a>
(1)</h2>
<p>2020-09-26.  Rooibos.  Basically an attempt to try rooibos first time
long time.  Not very interesting, but better than supermarket teabags.</p>

<h2>TWG Tea -
<a href="https://twgtea.com/teas/loose-leaf/jade-dragon-tea-1">Jade Dragon</a>
(5)</h2>
<p>2020-09-05.  Green tea.  I really enjoyed this one.  Done again
without scale, but even with just eyeballing cups turned out great.
Strong recommendation.</p>

<h2>Mariage Frères -
<a href="https://www.mariagefreres.com/UK/2-lung-ching-green-tea-china-T221.html">Lung Ching</a>
(3)</h2>
<p>2020-08-22.  Green tea.  Nice grass aromas.  I messed up when making.  I
did not have scale at the time, so half of the cups resulted too weak.
Good one.</p>
