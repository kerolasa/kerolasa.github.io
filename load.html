<title>Processing And Load Averages</title>

<h2>Processing And Load Averages</h2>
<p class="bread">A CPU-bound system's problems will be anticipated in the load
average. This is one of the most often misunderstood performance metrics. A
system's load is the number of processes that are ready to run, including ones
currently running. This number is measured at regular, frequent intervals. The
load average, therefore, is the average of this load number over a particular
interval of time. There actually are three load averages measured over
different periods of time: the most recent minute, the last five minutes, and
the last 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="bread">If there are four processes that are performing computations
while the system is doing nothing else, then the load average will be
approximately four. The three different measurements are present to indicate
recent trends. If the one-minute load average is ten, the five-minute figure is
four, and the 15-minute average is one, then you know not only that you have a
heavily loaded machine, but that the load has increased rapidly over the past
few minutes. If you got rid of several runaway processes, you would expect the
one-minute average to drop quickly, but the 15-minute average would continue to
remain high.</p>
<p class="bread">But what is a "high" load average? There is no single answer
to this question. The average does not consider the number of processors in a
system. A load average of eight on a single processor machine could be
indicative of a problem, but on a four-processor system it probably is
normal.</p>
<p class="bread">What type of process is "ready to run"? Any process that needs
some time on the CPU meets that description. And a process that is currently
running on a CPU is also considered "ready to run" (some older versions of
SunOS [5.0, 5.1, and 5.2] got that wrong). But the system also counts processes
that are in a state called "short-term disk wait." Such processes are not quite
ready to be scheduled for a CPU, but will be soon.</p>
<p class="bread">The inclusion of processes in short-term wait can skew the
load average higher than one might expect. A process that spends a great deal
of time reading and writing to a local disk will be included in the load
average. Waiting for input from a tty device is never considered a short-term
wait, so a process waiting for user input is not counted in the load average. A
process that spends most of its time reading and writing to a serial line, such
as uucico, kermit, or Z-modem, will not count toward a higher load. In most
cases, network I/O is not considered short-term. But there is one important
exception: NFS. A process waiting for an NFS read is regarded as a short-term
disk wait. As a result, if an NFS server goes down, the load average on the
clients will soar even though the CPU itself is not being used.</p>
<p class="bread">The load average is calculated primarily for the purposes of
the UNIX process-scheduling algorithm. The current system load is included when
calculating a process's CPU utilization, which in turn will affect the priority
that a process is given for scheduling. Because it is convenient to see that
number, utilities let us examine the load. But remember that this number is an
internal kernel event calculated for a specific purpose, and may not always
make sense to you and me.</p>
<p class="bread">The load averages should not be used as the sole means of
assessing a system's performance. The average is an excellent indicator, but
other information also needs to be considered. If you see a high load average,
you should find out why it's high. The answer may be that the high number is
actually perfectly normal and that nothing needs to be done to improve
performance.</p>
